# Resource IDs

## Requirements

* Disconnected clients must be able to generate IDs themselves to enable clients to function offline
* 

## Structure

To the extent possible, Resource IDs should be considered opaque UTF-8 strings. Resource IDs are used to 
provide resources with a unique, persistent identity and should not be considered to have semantic content. 
Semantic content, such as a person's name, or a URL, can change over time, while a resource's identity
must remain stable to ensure that object's 

There are a limited number of cases

### Application-defined resources

Application-defined resources include FormClasses for models defined by ActivityInfo, such as Workspaces,
Folder, Access Control Rules, etc.

Application-defined resource IDs must begin with the '_' character when URL encoded.


```
_applicationIdentifier
```

### User-defined resources

User-defined resources must be generated independently of the server to enable offline clients to function. To
avoid ID collisions, user-generated resources are generated using a scheme based on
[Com](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid). 

 
  

## Generation


IDs for resources are generated by clients themselves to enable clients to work offline to the greatest extent
possible. To avoid collision between clients, IDs are

Unique identifiers for ActivityInfo have a stricter list of requirements that 
cannot all be satisfied by any existing version of the GUID/UUID specifications:
